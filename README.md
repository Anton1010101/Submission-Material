The system requirements for the software to be executed are as follows:

Python 3.11.3.

NumPy, version 1.24.3 or any subsequent release.

PyPlot (Matplotlib), version 3.7.1 or any subsequent release.

I used the Visual Studio Code environment to develop and test these programs, utilizing Python version v2023.22.1.

To ensure the availability of necessary packages, it is recommended to have 'pip' installed, enabling the installation of NumPy and Matplotlib via the following commands:

pip install numpy


pip install matplotlib
